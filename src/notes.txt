NEW IDEA
-- You can pile up links with friends
-- each user can have series of friends they pile their links with
-- i have to learn how the structure of each user would be on the database

URGENT
-- i don't want users to be able to post a pile that already exists or is in the archived
-- display message when search doesn't exists
-- loading spinner when piles are about to Load
-- messages in the archived page

DONE
-- the new pile should be on top
-- i need to implement load more.
--implement generating links
--implement changing visibility
-- i need a default image for meta tage for post
--implement optimistical update on change category
-- adjust the state for category pick
-- see if i can change category optimistically

LEARN
--horizontal scaling
--Load balance
